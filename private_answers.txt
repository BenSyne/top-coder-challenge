ITERATION 1 SOLUTION (Score: 16,840)
==================================================================

ITERATION 1 FORMULA:
----------------
Base = 266.71 + 50.05×days + 0.4456×miles + 0.3829×receipts

This formula was derived using linear regression on the 1,000 public cases.

SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS:
-------------------

1. ROUNDING BUG (Factor: 0.457)
   - If receipts end in .49 or .99, multiply total by 0.457
   - This reduces reimbursement significantly
   - Example: $1000.49 receipts → reimbursement × 0.457

2. HIGH VALUE CAPS
   - Miles > 800: Only 25% rate for excess miles
   - Receipts > $1800: Only 15% rate for excess receipts
   - Prevents excessive reimbursements

3. TRIP-SPECIFIC MULTIPLIERS
   - 5-day trips: × 0.92 (contrary to interviews, they get penalized)
   - 7-8 day trips with high values: × 1.25 (boost for under-prediction)
   - 12+ day trips with high mileage: × 0.85 (reduction)
   - 13-14 day trips with high values: × 1.20 (boost)
   - Short trips (<2 days, minimal inputs): × 1.15 (boost)

4. EFFICIENCY BONUS
   - 180-220 miles per day: +$30 bonus
   - Rewards optimal travel efficiency

KEY FINDINGS FROM ANALYSIS:
--------------------------

1. Employee interviews were partially accurate:
   - ✓ Rounding bug exists (but REDUCES, not increases)
   - ✓ Efficiency sweet spot confirmed (180-220 miles/day)
   - ✗ 5-day trips get PENALTY, not bonus
   - ✓ Receipt thresholds exist
   - ✓ Mileage isn't standard $0.58/mile rate

2. The system is NOT:
   - A simple lookup table
   - Using standard IRS mileage rates
   - Purely linear without adjustments

3. Challenging cases:
   - High mileage trips (1000+ miles) are complex
   - Very high receipts ($2000+) follow different rules
   - No exact matches achieved (suggests additional hidden logic)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
----------------------
- Language: Python 3
- Core file: calculate_reimbursement.py
- Wrapper: run.sh
- No external dependencies
- Execution time: <1ms per calculation

SUBMISSION FILES:
----------------
- private_results.txt: 5,000 predictions (one per line)
- Each line corresponds to private_cases.json[index]
- Format: Simple float with 2 decimal places

METHODOLOGY:
-----------
1. Initial data exploration revealed non-linear patterns
2. Linear regression established baseline formula
3. Error analysis identified systematic biases
4. Iterative refinement added special case handling
5. 7 major iterations to reach final score

ITERATION 1 REMAINING CHALLENGES:
--------------------------------
- 0 exact matches suggest additional complexity
- Possible rounding to nearest $5 or $10 not captured
- May be discrete buckets or lookup tables for certain ranges
- Historical bugs may have become "features"

==================================================================
ITERATION 2 BREAKTHROUGH (Score: 12,710) - 4,130 POINT IMPROVEMENT
==================================================================

MAJOR DISCOVERY: SYSTEMATIC TRIP-LENGTH BIAS
--------------------------------------------
Strategic error analysis revealed our model had systematic under-prediction based on trip length:
• 62.9% under-predictions vs 37.1% over-predictions
• Different trip lengths needed different correction factors
• Top 20 worst cases were almost all under-predictions with $500-700 errors

ITERATION 2 NEW COMPONENTS:
--------------------------

1. RANGE-SPECIFIC MULTIPLIERS (2,224 point improvement)
   - Short trips (1-2 days): × 1.06 (6% boost needed)
   - Medium trips (3-4 days): × 1.09 (9% boost needed) 
   - Week trips (5-7 days): × 1.14 (14% boost needed)
   - Long trips (8-14 days): × 1.01 (minimal boost needed)
   - Extended trips (15-30 days): × 1.05 (5% boost needed)
   
   This fixed the systematic bias where we were under-predicting shorter trips significantly.

2. SURGICAL FIXES FOR WORST CASES (1,666 point improvement)
   After range optimization, we analyzed remaining worst cases and found specific patterns:
   
   • High-receipt 7-day trips (were over-predicted): × 0.85
     - Pattern: days == 7 AND receipts > $2000
   
   • 8-14 day moderate receipts (were under-predicted): × 1.15  
     - Pattern: 8 ≤ days ≤ 14 AND $900 ≤ receipts ≤ $1500 AND miles < 1200
   
   • Long high-mileage low-receipt trips: × 1.10
     - Pattern: days ≥ 12 AND miles ≥ 1000 AND receipts < $1200
   
   • Medium high-mileage trips: × 0.95
     - Pattern: 8 ≤ days ≤ 11 AND miles ≥ 1000 AND receipts ≥ $1000

ITERATION 2 COMPLETE FORMULA:
----------------------------
1. Start with iteration 1 base formula + all adjustments
2. Apply range-specific multipliers based on trip length
3. Apply surgical fixes for specific worst-case patterns
4. Final result: round(amount, 2)

DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS ON FORMER WORST CASES:
--------------------------------------------
• Case 985: $571 error → $179 error (68% improvement)
• Case 297: $586 error → $191 error (67% improvement)  
• Case 908: $620 error → $230 error (63% improvement)
• Case 528: $621 error → $230 error (63% improvement)

STRATEGIC INSIGHTS FROM ITERATION 2:
------------------------------------
• Data-driven error analysis beats theoretical approaches
• Systematic bias correction more valuable than chasing exact matches
• Surgical precision on remaining worst cases delivers high ROI
• Average error reduction prioritized over exact matches (scoring favors this)

METHODOLOGY THAT WORKED:
-----------------------
1. Systematic error pattern analysis (identify bias by trip length)
2. Range-specific multiplier optimization (fix systematic under-prediction)
3. Worst-case pattern identification (target remaining high-error cases)
4. Surgical precision fixes (address specific problematic patterns)
5. Validate each improvement before proceeding to next

FINAL MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
------------------------
• Linear base formula (proven coefficients)
• Value caps (prevent overweighting) 
• Legacy edge case adjustments (rounding bug, efficiency bonus, etc.)
• Range-specific multipliers (corrects trip-length bias) ← NEW
• Surgical worst-case fixes (targets remaining patterns) ← NEW
